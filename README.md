## Why?
Well, why not? Assist was created from the culmination of different ideas from many different individuals over a few months. Assist was made to replace the VALORANT icon on your desktop and become a hub for all VALORANT players. Assist brings a plethora of quality-of-life features that make of your experience a more pleasurable one, and only at a few clicks away. Assist does not replace the Riot Client, the official client continues to download, patch, authenticate and launch you into the game. Assist is made to be an extension launcher that is separate, but works together with the Riot Client to create an ideal gameplay environment for players.

## Features
  * Dashboard
    - Taking from the original dashboard we have revamped it. Now it gives you a bit of an insight into your day in VALORANT at a glance. Containing your Missions, recent stats, and the latest news.
  * Account Switcher
    - Allows you to add up to 5 accounts to Assist, allowing you to hotswap between them and launch Valorant without having to login everytime.
  * Store
    - You can now check your store without having to load up the game, simply click on the store tab and have a look!
  * And A LOT MORE in store for the future!
