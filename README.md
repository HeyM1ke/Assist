## Why?
Well, why not? Assist was created from the culmination of different ideas from many different individuals over a few months. Assist was made to replace the Valorant icon on your desktop. Assist brings a plethora of features that make your life easier and better with everything at a few click strokes away. Assist does not release the Riot Client, The Riot Client continues to Download, Patch, Authenticate and Launch you into the game. Assist is made to be an extension launcher that is separate but together to create a better launcher for players.

## Features
  * Dashboard
    - A Overview of your account and everything going on with Valorant.
  * Account Switcher
    - Allows you to add up to 5 accounts to assist, allowing you to hotswap between accounts and launch Valorant without having to login everytime.
  * Progression
    - Currently Progression is in its early stages, but currently you can check your battlepass progress. Agents and Missions are to be added in a near update.
  * Store
    - You can now check your store without having to load up the game now, simply click on the store tab and look at your store!
  * More to come in the future!
